# Arcade

The Tek 2 Epitech arcade project aims to develop classic games such as Snake and Pacman using various programming libraries such as ncurses, SDL2, and SFML. These games are designed as dynamic libraries, allowing users to load and unload libraries according to their preferences. A simple architecture is implemented to create multiple games simultaneously across the three libraries. You can refer to the documentation to obtain information about the project's architecture as you explore game design concepts, implementing features such as character movement, collision detection, and scoring systems.


## Installation

Installing the project is straightforward:

```bash
  > git clone git@github.com:Xer0ce/Arcade.git
  > cd Arcade
```

Executing it is just as simple:

```bash
  > make
  > ./arcade -h
    USAGE : ./arcade lib/arcade_lib.so
```

You can use `ls lib/`, to know the different libraries.


## Usage

To use the arcade, you can press these different keys:

```bash
• ARROW_UP: move upwards
• ARROW_DOWN: move downwards
• ARROW_LEFT: move left
• ARROW_RIGHT: move right
• M: Go to menu
• G: change game
• N: switch to the next graphics library
• E: Quit game"
```
